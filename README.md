THIS README FILES CONTAIN A SHORT INTRODUCTION ABOUT MYSELF

I was born in the city of Gaya. At the age of 3, I moved to Saudi Arabia where I completed my schooling and later moved back to India in 2014 to start my undergraduate education. This is my first time to the US. I did my schooling from International Indian School, Dammam, a school established under the Indian Embassy in Saudi in the year 1982. After finishing my high school, I majored in Mechanical Engineering from BIT, Mesra and now have moved to the US to pursue MS in Automotive Engineering from CU-ICAR. 
I was a summer intern for 2 months at Jamna Auto Industries Ltd which manufactures leaf springs for a company known as Tata Motors. I was assigned to correct Lateral Distortion occurring during the heat treatment process of manufacturing leaf springs. My track at CU-ICAR is Autonomy. Primarily, my interest lies in planning and development of V2X systems. I have taken up Autonomy Science and Systems, Automotive Stability and Safety systems and, Motion Planning. These courses combined will prepare me to be a part of this evolving industry and as part of the Deep Orange autonomy subteam member, I will get to apply it on developing a fully autonomous Indy Car.
